# Next-Word-Prediction
A data science project using NLP techniques that analyzes English (US) text from past Twitter feeds, News data and blogs, and then predicts the word that comes after the input word or sentence given by the user. This feature is similar to the search bar we come across in search engines like google.com, bing.com, etc. 
This repository has the project implemented using both LSTM model and Markov model.

I have created a Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

The working demo can be seen here:

I hope you like my project.
