# Next-Word-Prediction
A data science project using NLP techniques that analyzes English (US) text from past Twitter feeds, News data and blogs, and then predicts the word that comes after the input word or sentence given by the user. This feature is similar to the search bar we come across in search engines like google.com, bing.com, etc. Implemented using both LSTM model and Markov model.
